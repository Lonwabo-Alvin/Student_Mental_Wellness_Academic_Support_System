## Branch Protection Rules Justification

To maintain a stable and production-ready `main` branch, I have implemented strict branch protection rules in our GitHub repository. These rules are essential for enforcing quality control, promoting collaboration, and preventing the introduction of bugs or broken code.

### Pull Request Reviews
We require at least **one pull request review** before any code is merged into `main`. This ensures that:
- All code is peer-reviewed for quality and correctness.
- Team members collaborate and maintain shared accountability.
- Errors and inconsistencies are caught early through feedback.

### Required Status Checks
We enforce **passing status checks** (via GitHub Actions) before allowing merges. These automated checks:
- Run unit and integration tests.
- Ensure that code changes do not break the build.
- Help identify bugs before code reaches production.

### Disabling Direct Pushes
We have disabled **direct pushes** to `main`. All changes must go through a pull request, which:
- Enforces code reviews and testing.
- Prevents accidental or unreviewed changes to production code.
- Promotes a controlled, traceable development workflow.

## Why It Matters

These branch protection rules align with industry-standard DevOps practices. They ensure:
- Consistent code quality.
- Early detection of issues.
- A secure and reliable CI/CD pipeline.

By enforcing these rules, I am fostering a professional, team-oriented development environment that mirrors real-world software engineering standards.
