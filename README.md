# Student Mental Wellness Academic Support System

## Introduction
Studies have consistently shown that students' academic performance and mental health are significantly correlated. Mental health problems can negatively impact students' academic performance, as documented by research published in BMC Public Health[Public Health at BMC](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-20738-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and emphasized by the National Association of School Psychologists [National Association of School Psychologists (NASP)](https://www.nasponline.org/Documents/Research%20and%20Policy/Research%20Center/MentalHealthAcademicAchievement_2020.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com). These results highlight how crucial it is to address mental health issues in order to promote academic achievement among students.
* It has been observed that students' mental health poses a significant challenge, particularly during exam periods, and can have a major effect on their academic performance.  Stress, anxiety, and emotional difficulties are common among students, which may hinder concentration, cause burnout, and produce poor grades.
* In order to ensure academic success, the **Student Mental Wellness & Academic Support System** will be created to assist students in managing exam stress and preserving their mental health.

## Project Description
The **Student Mental Wellness Academic Support System** is a web application that identifies students struggling with mental health during exams and provides personalized support to help them succeed academically despite their challenges. It offers individualized mental health advice, recommends efficient study techniques, and includes a self-assessment test to gauge stress and anxiety levels. It will help students manage academic stress and succeed with integrity.

Once completed, the system will feature:
- Personalized mental health advice based on self-assessment results and structured recommendations., allowing students to better understand and manage their stress and anxiety levels. 
- Efficient study techniques tailored to individual needs
- A comprehensive resource library with articles and guides on mental health management
- An online support community for students to connect and share experiences
- Progress tracking tools to monitor mental health over time
- Quick access to emergency resources for those in immediate need of assistance.
- A supportive environment that promotes academic success and well-being.
- Support for students from various educational institutions facing mental health challenges that affect their academic performance are the focus of this system.  It acts as a preventive measure, creating a safe space where students can get the support they require without turning to destructive coping strategies like cheating or burnout.  The system's ultimate goals are to increase student engagement, boost academic achievement, and promote a healthier learning environment by treating mental health issues in an academic setting.

## Running Tests Locally (Java)

To run the project tests locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Java (JDK 11 or above) and Maven are installed.
2. Navigate to the root of the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```
- This command will:
- Clean previously compiled files.
- Compile the source code.
- Execute all unit and integration tests.
- Display the test results in your terminal.
#### All tests must pass before committing or creating a Pull Request

## Known Issue (In-Memory Repository Conflict)

- During the CI/CD setup, I encountered persistent issues related to the in-memory repository implementation.

-I initially switched to using the JPA repository, which is a generic interface and comes with built-in methods like `save()`, `findAll()`, and `deleteById()`. This change improved parts of my code, but it created **naming and implementation conflicts** with the existing in-memory repository.

-As a result:
- The in-memory repository now shows unresolved references and underlined file names.
- There are compatibility issues between the JPA-based service and the in-memory repository structure.
- Despite extensive searching and attempts to fix the issue, it remains unresolved at this time.

> Iâ€™ve tried multiple approaches to resolve this, including renaming, restructuring, and reviewing the repository pattern, but the issue persists.

= is the current reason why some test cases are failing or the build may not complete successfully in the CI/CD pipeline. I am continuing to work on resolving it and appreciate your understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-mental-health-system.git
cd student-mental-health-system
```

2. Build the project

```bash
# Using Maven
mvn clean install

# Using Gradle
gradle build
```

3. Run the tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Usage Example

```java
// Get repositories using the factory
StudentRepository studentRepo = RepositoryFactory.getStudentRepository("MEMORY");
CounselorRepository counselorRepo = RepositoryFactory.getCounselorRepository("MEMORY");

// Create a new student
Student student = new Student("S123", "John Doe", "john@example.com", "Computer Science", "Junior");
studentRepo.save(student);

// Create a counselor
Counselor counselor = new Counselor("C101", "Dr. Smith", "Anxiety Disorders");
counselorRepo.save(counselor);

// Create an appointment using Builder pattern
Appointment appointment = new AppointmentBuilder("A001")
    .withStudent(student)
    .withCounselor(counselor)
    .withDateTime(LocalDateTime.now().plusDays(1))
    .withStatus("SCHEDULED")
    .build();

// Use the singleton EmergencyResponseSystem
EmergencyResponseSystem.getInstance().processAlert(new EmergencyAlert(student, "HIGH", "Urgent assistance needed"));
```

## Architecture

The system follows clean architecture principles with:

- Core domain models (Student, Counselor, etc.)
- Repository interfaces for data access abstraction
- In-memory implementations for development and testing
- Design pattern implementations in separate packages

### Design Patterns

This project implements all six creational design patterns:

1. **Simple Factory**: `WellnessResourceFactory` for creating wellness resources
2. **Factory Method**: `AssessmentCreator` hierarchy for specialized assessment creation
3. **Abstract Factory**: `NotificationFactory` hierarchy for notification systems
4. **Builder**: `AppointmentBuilder` for simplified appointment creation
5. **Prototype**: `ResourcePrototype` for cloning pre-configured resources
6. **Singleton**: `EmergencyResponseSystem` for centralized emergency handling
