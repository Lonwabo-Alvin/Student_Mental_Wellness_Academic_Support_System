# Student Mental Wellness Academic Support System

## Introduction
Studies have consistently shown that students' academic performance and mental health are significantly correlated. Mental health problems can negatively impact students' academic performance, as documented by research published in BMC Public Health[Public Health at BMC](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-20738-9?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and emphasized by the National Association of School Psychologists [National Association of School Psychologists (NASP)](https://www.nasponline.org/Documents/Research%20and%20Policy/Research%20Center/MentalHealthAcademicAchievement_2020.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com). These results highlight how crucial it is to address mental health issues in order to promote academic achievement among students.
* It has been observed that students' mental health poses a significant challenge, particularly during exam periods, and can have a major effect on their academic performance.  Stress, anxiety, and emotional difficulties are common among students, which may hinder concentration, cause burnout, and produce poor grades.
* In order to ensure academic success, the **Student Mental Wellness & Academic Support System** will be created to assist students in managing exam stress and preserving their mental health.

## Project Description
The **Student Mental Wellness Academic Support System** is a web application that identifies students struggling with mental health during exams and provides personalized support to help them succeed academically despite their challenges. It offers individualized mental health advice, recommends efficient study techniques, and includes a self-assessment test to gauge stress and anxiety levels. It will help students manage academic stress and succeed with integrity.

Once completed, the system will feature:
- Personalized mental health advice based on self-assessment results and structured recommendations., allowing students to better understand and manage their stress and anxiety levels. 
- Efficient study techniques tailored to individual needs
- A comprehensive resource library with articles and guides on mental health management
- An online support community for students to connect and share experiences
- Progress tracking tools to monitor mental health over time
- Quick access to emergency resources for those in immediate need of assistance.
- A supportive environment that promotes academic success and well-being.
- Support for students from various educational institutions facing mental health challenges that affect their academic performance are the focus of this system.  It acts as a preventive measure, creating a safe space where students can get the support they require without turning to destructive coping strategies like cheating or burnout.  The system's ultimate goals are to increase student engagement, boost academic achievement, and promote a healthier learning environment by treating mental health issues in an academic setting.

 # Student Mental Wellness System

## Language Choice: Java
- **Strong Typing**: Ensures data integrity (e.g., valid email format).
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, composition, and polymorphism align with the class diagram.
- **Maven Support**: Simplifies dependency management and testing.

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Relationships**:
   - **Composition**: `MentalHealthAssessment` creates/owns `EmergencyAlert`.
   - **Associations**: `Student` ↔ `Appointment` (enforced via collection limits).
2. **Validation**:
   - Appointment limits (`Student` can’t book >3 appointments).
   - Score thresholds for triggering alerts.
3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Private fields with getters/setters.
   - Defensive copying of collections.

## How to Build
```bash
mvn clean install
```
## Creational Patterns Justification

1. **Singleton**: Used for `EmergencyAlertService` to ensure a single point of control for alert escalation  
2. **Builder**: Applied to `Student` due to optional fields (academicYear, major)  
3. **Factory Method**: Created `AssessmentFactory` to delegate PHQ-9/GAD-7 assessment creation  
4. **Abstract Factory**: Implemented `ResourceFactory` for topic-specific wellness resources  
5. **Prototype**: Clones preconfigured `WellnessResource` templates to avoid reinitialization  
6. **Simple Factory**: Centralizes creation of different appointment types
## Creational Patterns

### Factory Method
- **Use Case**: Delegate creation of PHQ-9 and GAD-7 assessments to specialized factories.
- **Why**: Allows adding new assessment types (e.g., a future "Stress Scale") without modifying existing code.

### Abstract Factory
- **Use Case**: Generate anxiety/depression-themed articles and videos as cohesive groups.
- **Why**: Ensures resources for a specific mental health topic are consistently configured.
### Factory Method Pattern
- **Use Case**: Create PHQ-9 and GAD-7 assessments using dedicated factories.
- **Why**:  
  - Decouples assessment creation logic from client code.  
  - Simplifies adding new assessment types (e.g., a future "Stress Scale").
