# Reflection: Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

## Introduction
As I work on developing the **Student Mental Wellness & Academic Support System**, I’ve encountered several challenges in balancing the needs of different stakeholders. Each group has unique priorities, and ensuring the system meets everyone's expectations requires careful consideration, trade-offs, and creative problem-solving. This reflection outlines the challenges I’ve faced so far, how I plan to address them, and the lessons I’m learning throughout the process.

## Challenges I’m Facing

### 1. **Conflicting Priorities**
- **Students** I am stucked between choosing features like instant notifications and personalized recommendations, but on  **IT team** I am concerned about system performance and bandwidth limitations, especially during peak usage (e.g., exam periods).
- **Counselors** wanted to emphasize the importance of early detection of mental health issues, while on **university administrators** I am thinking of focusing on cost-effectiveness and scalability.

### 2. **Data Privacy vs. Personalization**
- Students and counselors I wanted the system to provide highly personalized recommendations based on detailed mental health data. However, this raises concerns about **data privacy** and compliance with regulations like **FERPA** and **POPI**.
- Balancing the need for personalization with strict data privacy requirements is a significant challenge.

### 3. **Resource Constraints**
- The system needs to provide **24/7 availability** and **real-time feedback**, but I am thinking that with **IT team** there will be limitations in infrastructure and budget.
- Additionally, **content administrators** need frequent updates to mental health resources, which will require additional time and effort.

### 4. **Stigma Around Mental Health**
- With some stakeholders (e.g., students, parents) there are concerns about the **stigma** associated with using mental health tools, which could reduce system adoption.
- Ensuring the system is **non-intrusive** and **encouraging** is critical to overcoming this challenge.

## How I Plan to Address These Challenges

### 1. **Prioritizing Core Features**
- I plan to focus on delivering **core features** first, such as self-assessment tools and basic recommendations, while leaving advanced features (e.g., instant notifications, real-time chat) for future updates.
- This approach will allow me to address immediate stakeholder needs while managing technical and resource constraints.

### 2. **Ensuring Compliance with Data Privacy Regulations**
- I am planning on working closely with **legal experts** to ensure the system complies with data privacy regulations while still providing personalized recommendations.
- I plan to implement **anonymized data storage** and **role-based access control** to protect sensitive information.

### 3. **Designing for Scalability**
- To address resource constraints, I am designing the system with a **modular architecture** to allow for future scalability and updates.
- I also plan to use **cloud-based hosting** to ensure 24/7 availability and handle peak traffic during exam periods.

### 4. **Creating a User-Centric Design**
- I am planning on conducting **user testing** with students and counselors to ensure the system is intuitive and non-intrusive.
- I plan to add features like **anonymous self-assessments** and **positive reinforcement messages** to reduce stigma and encourage adoption.

## Conclusion
Balancing the needs of different stakeholders is one of the most challenging aspects of developing the **Student Mental Wellness & Academic Support System**. By prioritizing core features, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations, and designing a scalable and user-centric system, I aim to address the diverse needs of all stakeholders.
