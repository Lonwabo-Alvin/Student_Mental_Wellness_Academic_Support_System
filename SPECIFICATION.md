# System Specification
## Project Title
**Student Mental Wellness Academic Support System**
## Domain
**Education and Mental Health**
The domain of this project is **Education**. This system operates at the intersection of educational technology and mental health support, focused specifically on the academic environment. It targets higher education institutions, including universities and colleges, where academic pressure and stress are particularly high.The system addresses the mental health challenges that students face, particularly during high-pressure periods such as exams.By providing resources and personalized support, such as self-assessment tools and community forums, the system aims to foster a healthier learning environment and improve academic performance. Additionally, it seeks to promote awareness of mental health resources and encourage students to prioritize their well-being, ultimately leading to better academic outcomes, higher retention rates, and enhanced engagement. 
Collaboration with educational institutions will be key to integrating this system into existing support services, ensuring it effectively meets the diverse needs of students. My initial focus will be on incorporating the system into my current university, where I can tailor the resources and support to fit the specific needs of the student population. Furthermore, the system is designed to be adaptable and scalable, allowing it to cater to varying student populations across different educational contexts in the future.
